# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results-for-A-New-Webpage

This is my code for conducting the A/B test for a new webpage!

In this project, I used both a/b test and regression model to test whether the e-commerce company should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to see which page brings a higher costmer conversion rate. Based on the result, only the coefficient for CA_abpage is statistically significant. Holding all other variables constant, a user from Canada and receives a new page is 1.078 times more likely to convert. This number doesn't provide much pratical significance, unfortunally. The coefficients for other variables are not statistically significant, meaning they have no impact on the user coversion rate.

To sum up, we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis, and therefore, the company should keep the old page.
